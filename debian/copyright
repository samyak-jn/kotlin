License: Eclipse Public License, Version 1.0 (EPL-1.0)
 THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS ECLIPSE PUBLIC
 LICENSE ("AGREEMENT"). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM
 CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.

 1. DEFINITIONS

 "Contribution" means:

     a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial code and
        documentation distributed under this Agreement, and

     b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:
        i) changes to the Program, and
        ii) additions to the Program;

 where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from and are
 distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution 'originates'
 from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by such Contributor itself
 or anyone acting on such Contributor's behalf. Contributions do not include
 additions to the Program which: (i) are separate modules of software
 distributed in conjunction with the Program under their own license agreement,
 and (ii) are not derivative works of the Program.

 "Contributor" means any person or entity that distributes the Program.

 "Licensed Patents " mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which are
 necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone or
 when combined with the Program.

 "Program" means the Contributions distributed in accordance with
 this Agreement.
 
 "Recipient" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement,
 including all Contributors.

 2. GRANT OF RIGHTS

    a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants
       Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to
       reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly
       perform, distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such
       Contributor, if any, and such derivative works,
       in source code and object code form.

    b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants
       Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under
       Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and
       otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor, if any,
       in source code and object code form. This patent license shall apply
       to the combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at the time
       the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition of the
       Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the
       Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other
       combinations which include the Contribution.
       No hardware per se is licensed hereunder.

    c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the
       licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are
       provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the
       patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity.
       Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims
       brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual
       property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the
       rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes
       sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights
       needed, if any. For example, if a third party patent license is
       required to allow Recipient to distribute the Program, it is
       Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license
       before distributing the Program.

    d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient
       copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright
       license set forth in this Agreement.

	3. REQUIREMENTS

	A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form under
	its own license agreement, provided that:

	    a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and

	    b) its license agreement:

	        i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties
	        and conditions, express and implied, including warranties or
	        conditions of title and non-infringement, and implied warranties or
	        conditions of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose;

	        ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability
	        for damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and
	        consequential damages, such as lost profits;

	        iii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are
	        offered by that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and

	        iv) states that source code for the Program is available from such
	        Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable
	        manner on or through a medium customarily used for software exchange.

	When the Program is made available in source code form:

	    a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and
	    b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the Program.

	Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained
	within the Program.

	Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its Contribution,
	if any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent Recipients to
	identify the originator of the Contribution.

	4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION

	Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with
	respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this license is
	intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the Contributor who
	includes the Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a manner
	which does not create potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore,
	if a Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering,
	such Contributor ("Commercial Contributor") hereby agrees to defend and
	indemnify every other Contributor ("Indemnified Contributor") against any
	losses, damages and costs (collectively "Losses") arising from claims,
	lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third party against the
	Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of
	such Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program
	in a commercial product offering. The obligations in this section do not apply
	to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged intellectual
	property infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must:
	a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in writing of such claim,
	and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control, and cooperate with the
	Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any related settlement
	negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in any such
	claim at its own expense.

	For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product
	offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor.
	If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, or offers
	warranties related to Product X, those performance claims and warranties
	are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility alone. Under this section,
	the Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims against the other
	Contributors related to those performance claims and warranties, and if a
	court requires any other Contributor to pay any damages as a result,
	the Commercial Contributor must pay those damages.

	5. NO WARRANTY

	EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN
	"AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR
	IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE,
	NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
	Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of
	using and distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its
	exercise of rights under this Agreement , including but not limited to the
	risks and costs of program errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to
	or loss of data, programs or equipment, and unavailability
	or interruption of operations.

	6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY

	EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY
	CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL,
	SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION
	LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN
	CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE)
	ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE
	EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE
	POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

	7. GENERAL

	If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under
	applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the
	remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further action by
	the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent
	necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.

	If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity (including a
	cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program itself
	(excluding combinations of the Program with other software or hardware)
	infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's rights granted
	under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

	All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails to
	comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement and
	does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after becoming
	aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's rights under this
	Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the
	Program as soon as reasonably practicable. However, Recipient's obligations
	under this Agreement and any licenses granted by Recipient relating to the
	Program shall continue and survive.

	Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement,
	but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and may
	only be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward reserves
	the right to publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement
	from time to time. No one other than the Agreement Steward has the right to
	modify this Agreement. The Eclipse Foundation is the initial
	Agreement Steward. The Eclipse Foundation may assign the responsibility to
	serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate entity. Each new version
	of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing version number. The Program
	(including Contributions) may always be distributed subject to the version
	of the Agreement under which it was received. In addition, after a new version
	of the Agreement is published, Contributor may elect to distribute the Program
	(including its Contributions) under the new version. Except as expressly
	stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no rights or
	licenses to the intellectual property of any Contributor under this Agreement,
	whether expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the
	Program not expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved.

	This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and the
	intellectual property laws of the United States of America. No party to
	this Agreement will bring a legal action under this Agreement more than one
	year after the cause of action arose. Each party waives its rights to a
	jury trial in any resulting litigation.

License: Netscape Public License
	The version of Rhino used in GWT is licensed under a dual license,
	Netscape Public License 1.1 / GNU General Public License.
	The text of the Netscape Public License
	is provided below (http://website-archive.mozilla.org/www.mozilla.org/mpl/MPL/NPL/1.1/):

	AMENDMENTS

	The Netscape Public License Version 1.1 ("NPL") consists of the
	Mozilla Public License Version 1.1 with the following Amendments,
	including Exhibit A-Netscape Public License.  Files identified with
	"Exhibit A-Netscape Public License" are governed by the Netscape
	Public License Version 1.1.

	Additional Terms applicable to the Netscape Public License.

	    I. Effect.

	       These additional terms described in this Netscape Public
	       License -- Amendments shall apply to the Mozilla Communicator
	       client code and to all Covered Code under this License.

	   II. ''Netscape's Branded Code'' means Covered Code that Netscape
	       distributes and/or permits others to distribute under one or
	       more trademark(s) which are controlled by Netscape but which
	       are not licensed for use under this License.

	  III. Netscape and logo.

	       This License does not grant any rights to use the trademarks
	       "Netscape'', the "Netscape N and horizon'' logo or the
	       "Netscape lighthouse" logo, "Netcenter", "Gecko", "Java" or
	       "JavaScript", "Smart Browsing" even if such marks are included
	       in the Original Code or Modifications.

	   IV. Inability to Comply Due to Contractual Obligation.

	       Prior to licensing the Original Code under this License,
	       Netscape has licensed third party code for use in Netscape's
	       Branded Code. To the extent that Netscape is limited
	       contractually from making such third party code available under
	       this License, Netscape may choose to reintegrate such code into
	       Covered Code without being required to distribute such code in
	       Source Code form, even if such code would otherwise be
	       considered ''Modifications'' under this License.

	    V. Use of Modifications and Covered Code by Initial Developer.

	        V.1. In General.

	             The obligations of Section 3 apply to Netscape, except to
	             the extent specified in this Amendment, Section V.2 and
	             V.3.

	        V.2. Other Products.

	             Netscape may include Covered Code in products other than
	             the Netscape's Branded Code which are released by
	             Netscape during the two (2) years following the release
	             date of the Original Code, without such additional
	             products becoming subject to the terms of this License,
	             and may license such additional products on different
	             terms from those contained in this License.

	        V.3. Alternative Licensing.

	             Netscape may license the Source Code of Netscape's
	             Branded Code, including Modifications incorporated
	             therein, without such Netscape Branded Code becoming
	             subject to the terms of this License, and may license
	             such Netscape Branded Code on different terms from those
	             contained in this License.

	    VI. Litigation.

	        Notwithstanding the limitations of Section 11 above, the
	        provisions regarding litigation in Section 11(a), (b) and (c)
	        of the License shall apply to all disputes relating to this
	        License.

	 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies

	[This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL.  It also counts
	 as the successor of the GNU Library General Public License, version 2, hence
	 the version number 2.1.]

	                            Preamble

	  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
	freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
	Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change
	free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.

	  This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some
	specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the
	Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You
	can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether
	this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better
	strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.

	  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,
	not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that
	you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge
	for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get
	it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of
	it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do
	these things.

	  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
	distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these
	rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for
	you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.

	  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis
	or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave
	you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source
	code.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide
	complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them
	with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling
	it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.

	  We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the
	library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal
	permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.

	  To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that
	there is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is
	modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know
	that what they have is not the original version, so that the original
	author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be
	introduced by others.

	  Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of
	any free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot
	effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a
	restrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that
	any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be
	consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.

	  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the
	ordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser
	General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and
	is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use
	this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those
	libraries into non-free programs.

	  When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using
	a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a
	combined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary
	General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the
	entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General
	Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with
	the library.

	  We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it
	does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General
	Public License.  It also provides other free software developers Less
	of an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages
	are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many
	libraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain
	special circumstances.

	  For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to
	encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes
	a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must be
	allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free
	library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this
	case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free
	software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.

	  In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free
	programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of
	free software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in
	non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU
	operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating
	system.

	  Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the
	users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is
	linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run
	that program using a modified version of the Library.

	  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
	modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a
	"work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library".  The
	former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must
	be combined with the library in order to run.
